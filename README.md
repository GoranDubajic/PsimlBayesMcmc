# Bayesian Data Analysis and Markov Chain Monte Carlo

Tools and code for Bayesian data analysis and Markov chain Monte Carlo workshops.

1. [R programming language](https://www.r-project.org/) and [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
2. [JAGS (Just Another Gibbs Sampler)](http://mcmc-jags.sourceforge.net/)

All stuff should be portable i.e. working on Linux, Mac and Windows, however we only test it on Windows.
#### R and RStudio
To install R follow "download R" link, choose your mirror and install the latest version.

RStudio is great IDE for R and can be directly download from link [Download RStudio Desktop](http://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/)

[Resources to learn R](https://github.com/qinwf/awesome-R?utm_campaign=Data%2BElixir&utm_medium=web&utm_source=Data_Elixir_33#resources).

If you do not know where to start [An Introduction to R](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-intro.html) is quite good.
